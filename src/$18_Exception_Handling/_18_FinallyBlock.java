    //----> Explanation :
        - try block inside meth1() throws an Exception.
        - Before the method terminates, the finally block executes first, printing "Finally statement".
        - Since the exception is not caught, it propagates to the calling method (main()), leading to a runtime crash after printing the "Finally statement".

        âœ” Order of Execution:
        - finally block executes before the exception propagates to main().
        - Since main() also does not handle the exception, the program crashes after finally executes.
