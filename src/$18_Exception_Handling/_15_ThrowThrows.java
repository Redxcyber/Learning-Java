        üìå Why No Compilation Error Occurs even if Exception is checked exception
            -> The program compiles successfully because every method that can throw an exception declares throws Exception in its signature.
            -> Checked exceptions (like Exception) must be either handled using try-catch or declared using throws.
            -> Here, the exception is declared but not handled, so the program compiles but crashes at runtime when the exception is thrown.
