    ðŸ”¥ Benefits of This Change:
    âœ… More Flexibility: meth1() only declares an exception, leaving it to the caller to handle.
    âœ… Better Exception Propagation: meth2() now decides how to handle the exception.
    âœ… More Realistic Scenario: In real-world applications, we often propagate exceptions up the call stack for centralized handling.

    Your previous code was correct, but if you want better exception handling and code structure, consider propagating the exception instead of catching it in meth1().
